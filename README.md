webletter
=========
Webletter is a simple tool to create letters from tex templates.

(1) Installation
To install Webletter, simply copy both folders client and server to your webspace.
Note that it requires pdflatex to work properly.
This is still under development, this means many things won't work as you'd expect, e.g. the path to the php script is hardcoded.

Any patches, bug reports or pull requests are welcome.
